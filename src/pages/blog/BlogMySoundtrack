      <p>Music has always been the undercurrent of my life‚Äîsometimes loud and brash, sometimes quiet and grounding, but always there.</p>

      <p>As a little kid, I was constantly singing: in the car, to myself, to anyone who would listen. My mom blasted Carole King‚Äôs <em>Tapestry</em> in her little Yugo, filling our rides with the ache of ‚ÄúSo Far Away.‚Äù My brother Jimmy, on the other hand, made sure the whole house knew he was going to <em>fight for his right to party</em>‚Äîblasting Beastie Boys and N.W.A. from his bedroom until the walls practically shook. My sister and I choreographed Lisa Loeb‚Äôs <em>Stay</em> on the jungle gym, convinced we were destined for Olympic floor routines. Music wasn‚Äôt just entertainment; it was oxygen.</p>

      <p>High school cemented that bond. While some kids ruled the cafeteria, I ruled the band and choir rooms. Jazz Band mornings gave me peace before the chaos of the day. Swing Choir gave me sparkle. A school trip to Toronto gave me the surreal joy of seeing Paul Stanley from KISS as the Phantom of the Opera. And in an almost comical oversight, our small-town Wisconsin high school took us to see <em>RENT</em>‚Äîclearly not realizing what it was about. It didn‚Äôt exactly change my life, but it cracked open my eyes to what musicals could be. Suddenly it wasn‚Äôt just Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein or Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äîit was rock, grit, and modern storytelling. A whole new world of music-driven theatre was out there, and I wanted more.</p>

      <p>I was even chosen for the Dorian Vocal Festival in Iowa, where I sang alongside the best young voices in the Midwest. By senior year, music had given me something nothing else had: recognition. I walked away with the National School Choral Award <em>and</em> the John Philip Sousa Award, proof that my hours in the practice rooms mattered.</p>

      <p>College tried to tell me to ‚Äúbe practical.‚Äù I declared a Biotechnology major, but a D in Biology proved otherwise. I pivoted to music, studying theory, dictation, voice, piano (badly), and history. When I realized piano wasn‚Äôt my destiny, I turned to another mic: the college radio station. <em>The Blonde Moment</em> was born‚Äîa weekly radio show where my co-host and I took requests from dorms, and even from prisoners at the county jail, while spinning everything from Ani to Nelly. Somewhere in a box, I still have a cassette recording of that show, waiting for me to rescue it before it disintegrates.</p>

      <p>In 2006, life surprised me again. Working in HR at Copps and Pick ‚Äôn Save, I overheard a coworker mention she sang in the Madison Opera Chorus. Suddenly, a door opened. Within months, I was on stage, singing music that stretched me further than I‚Äôd ever gone before. Over the years, I performed in eight operas‚Äîincluding <em>Carmen</em> while pregnant with Porter, his tiny kicks echoing in time with Bizet.</p>

      <p>Even now, music is my pulse. I still spin the women of the ‚Äô90s who raised me‚ÄîTori Amos, Ani DiFranco, Alanis Morissette, Fiona Apple. But I‚Äôve also found myself unexpectedly wrapped up in Taylor Swift‚Äôs world. Once ‚Äúthat country girl,‚Äù she grew, healed, and sharpened her words into weapons. Her lyrics now slice through me: <em>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on your own, kid, you always have been.‚Äù</em> <em>‚ÄúI was a functioning alcoholic ‚Äôtil nobody noticed my new aesthetic.‚Äù</em> It‚Äôs therapy in disguise.</p>

      <p>If you peek at one of my playlists, you‚Äôll hear my ADHD on full display: House of Pain‚Äôs <em>Jump Around</em> crashing into Taylor‚Äôs <em>Bejeweled,</em> then bursting into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the queen of the castle‚Äù from <em>Six the Musical.</em> It‚Äôs chaos. It‚Äôs joy. It‚Äôs me.</p>

      <p>And tonight‚Äîit all comes full circle. I‚Äôm seeing Ani DiFranco for the third time, but this time with Porter. They‚Äôre drawn to Ani not just as an artist but as a feminist, an activist, a truth-teller. I can‚Äôt wait for them to feel that spark live, in a room filled with people who know music can be both rebellion and refuge.</p>

      <p>Because that‚Äôs what music has always been for me: a safe place, a rallying cry, and a reminder that our voices matter.</p>

      <p><strong>Here‚Äôs to Ani tonight. Here‚Äôs to Porter hearing the soundtrack of resistance and healing. And here‚Äôs to music‚Äîthe thread that has always, always held me together.</strong></p>
