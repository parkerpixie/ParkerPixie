      <article class="content">
        <p>For most of my life, I lived for other people. I did what was expected of me, what kept other people happy, what avoided rocking the boat. Especially when it came to my mother — a woman who thrived on control, criticism, and reminding me that my worth was conditional.</p>
        <p>And when you live like that long enough, you stop naming your feelings. You stop asking yourself, <em>Why am I upset?</em> or <em>Why does this hurt me?</em> Instead, it all boils down to one big emotion: anger. And anger was the only language I knew.</p>
        <p>But here’s the problem: anger wasn’t working. It didn’t solve anything. It didn’t make me feel better. It didn’t change the systems, the people, or the injustices that pissed me off in the first place...</p>

        <h2>🚪 Recovery Made Me Stop and Ask Why</h2>
        <p>When I started my recovery journey, I had to relearn how to feel. And not just feel — but name those feelings. <strong>This is grief. This is disappointment. This is shame. This is injustice.</strong></p>
        <p>Because once I could name the emotion, I could finally ask: <em>Why am I feeling this way? What is this pointing to?</em></p>
        <p>That’s when things started to shift...</p>

        <h2>⚡ Anger Is a Value Misaligned</h2>
        <p>Here’s what I’ve learned: most of my anger comes from something happening that doesn’t align with my values...</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Lack of transparency</li>
          <li>Sneaky, manipulative systems</li>
          <li>People taking advantage of those who are already disadvantaged</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That’s why I lose my shit when I’m stuck in an endless loop with State Farm or Verizon... Or when I sat in a hospital bed and they tried to prescribe me one of the two medications I’m literally allergic to...</p>

        <p>This is why I now pay extra out of pocket for a direct primary care doctor, <strong>Dr. Wendy Molaska</strong>... </p>

        <p>Same with <strong>Anker</strong>, the company behind my Soundcore earbuds... </p>

        <h2>💣 The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>And then there’s the world around us. Every day, it feels like one more headline breaks me open:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Another school shooting.</li>
          <li>Another person killed while the so-called “party of American values” clutches their pearls in shock—after cheering “guns for all.”</li>
          <li>Another family crying out for mental health support that doesn’t exist...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No wonder we’re all angry. But anger alone isn’t moving the needle.</p>

        <h2>✨ Choosing Differently</h2>
        <p>I’m not saying I roll over now. Absolutely not. I still stand my ground... </p>
        <p>Because here’s the truth: <strong>kindness is not weakness. Kindness rules the day.</strong></p>

        <h2>📖 Where to Begin</h2>
        <p>If this all feels overwhelming and you’re wondering where to even start, I’ll tell you what has helped me: <strong>The Let Them Theory</strong>, popularized by Mel Robbins...</p>
        <p>👉 If you want a place to start, read her book. Seriously. Check out <a href="https://www.melrobbins.com" target="_blank">Mel Robbins’ website here</a>.</p>

        <h2>🌱 Why I’m Sharing This</h2>
        <p>I’m sharing this because I know I’m not the only one who’s tired... </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You’re not crazy for feeling angry.</li>
          <li>You’re not weak for wanting peace.</li>
          <li>You don’t have to burn your whole life down to stand for your values.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You only need to start by naming your feelings, asking why, and then choosing differently.</p>
        <p>That’s how we turn anger into alignment. That’s how we build a kinder world. That’s how we make the whole damn place shimmer.</p>
