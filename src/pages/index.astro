        <h3>üå± Early Roots</h3>
        <p>I was raised in the early 80s, learning independence the hard way while trying to figure out who I was. My childhood was a mixed bag: a half-brother 10 years older first sparked my love of music by blasting the good stuff from the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
        <p>After my parents divorced and I lost contact with my dad and brother, I moved to a beef farm with my mom and stepdad. Life there was full of animals ‚Äî steers, calves, pigs, goats, even llamas ‚Äî and I loved every second of it. I showed steers at the county fair, and those memories still make me smile.</p>

      <!-- Music years -->
      <article class="step">
        <h3>üé∂ Music Years</h3>
        <p>In high school, music became everything. I was determined, stubborn, and hungry for piccolo rights (so I fought my way to first chair flute as a freshman ‚Äî even if only for a week). I learned every woodwind, played tenor sax in jazz band, spun in color guard, and even filled in on percussion when needed.</p>
        <p>Choir was my heartbeat: honors choir, swing choir, the Dorian Vocal Festival. I went on to win both the <em>National School Choral Award</em> and the <em>John Philip Sousa Award</em> ‚Äî the top honors in band and choir ‚Äî sweeping them as one determined girl.</p>
        <div class="quote">‚ÄúI grew up stifled by perfection and rules that changed on a whim ‚Äî but the wonder was always there, waiting.‚Äù</div>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>üéì Finding My Way (and ADHD)</h3>
        <p>College at River Falls was messy but formative. I bounced through five majors before finally graduating with a B.A. in Psychology and a self-made minor in Broad Field Social Studies ‚Äî proof of my endless curiosity. I didn‚Äôt know it then, but ADHD was driving that restlessness. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until age 42, and looking back, I‚Äôm proud that I made it through anyway.</p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>üíú Love & Family</h3>
        <p>I met Blake in college through a friend who grew up with him. After our first date, I told my resident (RA): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna marry this guy.‚Äù And I did ‚Äî in 2006. Almost 20 years later, he‚Äôs still my biggest cheerleader: the one who gets me, accepts the chaos, helps me navigate family drama, and teaches me new ways to communicate and live with more grace.</p>
        <p>In 2010, Porter arrived and I went full mom-mode. None of my friends were in the same stage, so I turned to a brand-new platform: YouTube. Back then it was all community, no algorithms, and I found my people in the TTC and mommy groups.</p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>üìπ The YouTube Era</h3>
        <p>I became <strong>InformationMommy</strong>, sharing fact-based, sassy, no-nonsense videos on everything from cloth diapering to vaccine research to day-in-the-life chaos. Over 1,000 subscribers later, I had built a little community that turned into real friendships ‚Äî women I met up with, confided in, and leaned on.</p>
        <p>That community showed me the power of connection: finding people who are walking through the same season as you. It was also the first time I started uncovering <em>me</em> ‚Äî not just the daughter of a narcissist, not just a wife or mom, not just an employee, but Parker.</p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>üç∑ Struggle & Recovery</h3>
        <p>Life got hard. Jobs with endless travel blurred into work-from-home life, and alcohol became my coping tool ‚Äî a mask over anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. By the time my skin was jaundiced and I was diagnosed with liver disease, I had nearly lost it all. Twice I almost died.</p>
        <p>But that wasn‚Äôt my ending ‚Äî it was my beginning. I chose recovery and healing. I dug into my past, forgave myself, comforted the little girl who never had what she needed, and built a new toolkit for when life inevitably gets messy again.</p>
